Assignment 3:
added devise gem for authentication of the user. added a simple navbar through layouts/application.html.erb
I mostly followed this guide here for setting up devise https://guides.railsgirls.com/devise
I am impressed about how easy it is to implement a user login feature through a rails gem as this would traditionally be a more
difficult task to implement. The navbar was also easier than expected as the html code is applied through all of the views in
rails. 
Could add more to navbar and look of page in the future.
